Credit Card Customer Predictive Analysis

**Credit Card Customer Predictive Analysis

--Overview

This project focuses on predictive analysis using a credit card dataset sourced from Kaggle, containing data on 10,000 customers and 18 features. The goal is to gain insights into customer behavior, reduce attrition and enhance customer satisfaction through data-driven strategies. Various statistical models and techniques were used to predict outcomes and uncover actionable insights.

--Project Objective

The main question addressed is:

•	How can credit card companies better understand and predict customer behavior to reduce attrition and improve customer engagement?

--Approach
1.	Data Understanding and Cleaning

Conducted data cleaning to ensure there were no missing values in critical variables.

Performed exploratory data analysis (EDA) to identify distributions, correlations, and patterns within the dataset.

2.	Predictive Modeling

Implemented simple and multiple linear regression models to predict credit limits based on variables such as months inactive and other customer characteristics.

Conducted statistical tests (e.g., chi-square tests) and correlation analysis to identify relationships between key variables.

3.	Insights and Recommendations

Provided insights into customer demographics, card usage patterns, and predictors of credit limit allocation.

Suggested strategies for improving retention by targeting specific customer segments.




Key Findings

•	Customer Segmentation: Most customers had an annual income below $40K, with Blue card types being the most common.

•	Predictive Factors: Significant predictors of credit limits included customer age, transaction amounts, and average utilization ratio.

•	Gender and Card Preference: A significant association was found between gender and card type, with Blue cards being more popular among female customers.

Limitations and Future Enhancements

1.	Advanced Modeling Techniques: The project primarily relied on regression models. Future work could incorporate machine learning algorithms (e.g., decision trees, random forests) to enhance prediction accuracy.

2.	Feature Engineering: Additional derived features could be created to capture more nuanced behaviors and improve model performance.

3.	Expanding the Dataset: Including more diverse demographic and transactional data could improve generalizability and reveal deeper insights.

How to Access the Code

The code is contained within a .egp file (SAS Enterprise Guide Project). To open and execute the code, SAS Enterprise Guide is required.  I am sorry I was not able to convert the files to .txt I don’t have the SAS Access any longer.
